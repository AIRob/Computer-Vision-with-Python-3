## Computer Vision with Python 3

This is the code repository for [Computer Vision with Python 3](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/computer-vision-python-3?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788299763), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
Go to Mapt

## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
private void initialiseBluetooth() {
bluetoothManager = 
(BluetoothManager)getSystemService
(Context.BLUETOOTH_SERVICE);
bluetoothAdapter = bluetoothManager.getAdapter();
bluetoothLeScanner = bluetoothAdapter.getBluetoothLeScanner(); 
}
```

This book will guide you through the installation of all the tools that you need to follow the code samples. Code samples introduced in various chapters are for both Android and iOS platforms hence you will need to install the Android Studio and XCode IDEs. Since simulators lack Bluetooth functionality, hence you will need physical Android and iOS devices to run the code samples. In terms of hardware, you will be needing a Raspberry Pi for the Code Lab specific for Chapter 5, Beacons with Raspberry Pi. For Chapter 4, Designing a Personal Tracking System, and Chapter 6, Weather Monitoring Using BLE in Warehouses, you will be needing a very low cost iTag and the Texas Instruments Sensor Tag. All of the hardware can be easily procured online.
